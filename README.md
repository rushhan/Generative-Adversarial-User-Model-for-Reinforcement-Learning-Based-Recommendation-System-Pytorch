# Generative-Adversarial-User-Model-for-Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Recommendation-System-Pytorch
Pytorch implementation of Recommendation System based on Generative Adverserial Reinforcement Learning based user Model
Implementation of the paper under same title  [paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19f/chen19f.pdf)

## This Repo Include:
1. Data Necessary (Yelp Reviews)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Position Weigth (PW) Model
4. Hyperparameter Tuned Model


## To Train:
Simply Run reco_gan_rl jupyter notebook. It includes both preprocessing of the data as well as training

## To DO:
1. Add LSTM Model

## Note:
The data processing is mainly based on original implementation so that the results could be compared .[Source](https://github.com/xinshi-chen/GenerativeAdversarialUserModel)
